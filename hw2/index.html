<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    <div> This project was all about geometric modeling. Specifically, this had us design a program to build Bezier curves and surfaces, as well as to work with mesh-traversal algorithms to implement weighted vector normals (to create smooth shading), flip and split edges, and divide meshes to convert a coarse polygon mess to a higher-resolution polygon mesh. In all, this project had us iteratively improve a naive implementation of a polygon mesh dispaly program into a more impressive one with model-editing functionality. </div>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    A <strong>Bezier Curve</strong> is a 2-dimensional parametric curve used in computer graphics to represent smooth surfaces given only three points.
    The <strong>de Casteljau Algorithm</strong> gives us a recursive way to find one point on a Bezier curve, dependent on <i>t</i>. The algorithm is given two parameters, a set of vectors {<strong>p</strong><sub>1</sub>, <strong>p</strong><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <strong>p</strong><sub>n</sub>} (represented by a <code>std::vector&lt;Vector2D&gt;</code>) and 0 &le; <i>t</i> &le; 1 (represented by a <code>float</code>).
    It recursively reduces the set of vectors to a slightly smaller set with linearly interpolated points. Specifically, it transforms the set:
    <br>
    <div align="middle">
        <img src="images/lerp.png" align="middle" width="50%" />
    </div>
    <br>
    We repeat this process until we get to one singular point, and this point lies on the Bezier Curve.
</p>

  Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    As mentioned in Part 1, de Casteljau's Algorithm works well to calculate a point on a Bezier curve given the set of points that define the curve.
    Though the algorithm is only well-defined for the case for colinear points, we can still use the algorithm to evaluate a point on a <strong>Bezier surface</strong> (a 3D abstraction of the 2D bezier curve).
    For this to work, we must define the pair of hyperparameters <i>(u, v)</i>, which similar to <i>t</i> in the 2-dimensional case, define where on the curve to evaluate a point.
    <br><br>
    Specifically, for the line along <i>u</i>, evaluate all the points on the Bezier curves that lie on this line. In other words, evaluate the points of all of Bezier curves that make up some axis of the Bezier surface at the hyperparameter <i>t = u</i>, where <i>t</i> is that of Part (1).
    Then, evaluate the point on the Bezier curve defined by all of the points that were just evaluated at hyperparameter <i>t</i> = <i>v</i>.
    To evaluate all of the points on a given Bezier surface, we apply this aforementioned algorithm to all desired hyperparameters <i>(u, v)</i>.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    To calculate the area-weighted vertex normals, I computed the normal vector of each triangular face adjacent to the given vertex which had a magnitude of that triangle's area.
    Specifically, I traversed each adjacent triangle and saved their vertices. Before moving on to the next triangle (using dynamic programming to save memory), I used the distance formula to
    interpolate a base and height of the triangle to calculate the area. Then, to calculate the norm, I found two vertices on the triangle face using vector subtraction and then calculated the cross product
    to find the orthogonal vector, making sure to have the desired orientation. Finally, I summed the product all these cross products with their areas to get the area-weighted normal.

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    In an edge flip, there are two relevant faces, four relevant vertices, five relevant edges, and six relevant half-edges. It is a lot to keep track of, so I found it helpful to first draw a labeled diagram. In the code, I used a variable for all of the above mesh elements that needed pointer reassignment, or would be involved in the pointer reassignment of another element. Using descriptive variable names was key for making sure everything was assigned correctly. Fortunately, this task went very smoothly.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    This operation is even more complicated than edge flipping; not only does it involve more elements, but it involves creating new ones. Just like with edge flipping, I used a varible for each important mesh element with a desciptive name. One choice I made was to recycle the edges that was being split, using it as the "bottom half" of the split edge. That way I didn't have to deal with deleting mesh elements, just creating new ones.

    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    While edge flipping went smoothly, splitting did not. If one does not assign some value to each of the fields of a new mesh element, the program will crash when trying to do a split. So while a crash indicated that not all the reassignments were being done correctly, I could not get a visual indication of something being wrong. It turns out that it is easy to forget about some assignments when there are so many to be done.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    For loop subdivision, it was helpful to break up the process into steps, as suggested. First, I calculated the new positions for the vertices and the new vertices created by splitting edges; then I performed all of the necessary edge operations to get the correct mesh topology, and finally I assigned the vertices their previously-calculated positions. When doing all of the ede splits, it was important to keep track of which edges were new so that I don't just keep splitting indefinitely. For this, I modified the edge splitting function to set an isNew value to true for the new edges.
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>

<br>

    <p>As you can see, sharp corners and edges are smoothed out through this subdivision. This was also explained in class, here is the relevant slide.</p>
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">

            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <br>

    <p>As for pre-splitting edges, this may help raise the resolution of the image due to there being more vertices to interpolate. The algorithm would not be tricked into thinking that sharp edges should be smoothed out. Allowing more edges in this way will allow the loop subdivision algorithm to interpolate the corners as sharp where they would not be otherwise.</p>

  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
    These asymetries ocur because the vertices are not topoloically isomorphic. That is, the local area around each vertex differs slightly.

<p>
    We can fix this by spliting each edge that goes across a face of the cube, so that each
    square face of the cube consists of four triangles. This makes the starting mesh topology invariant under all
    symmetries of the cube, which is what we need.
